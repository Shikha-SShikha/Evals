      "title": "Enhancement of Carrier Separation and Overall Water Splitting Performance by Nitrogen Doping in SrTiO3",
      "abstract": "Enhancing the photocatalytic performance of SrTiO3 through bandgap modification via nitrogen doping is a widely used approach. However, our study reveals that N-doped SrTiO3 may exhibit additional mechanisms contributing to its improved performance. In this study, SrTiO3 was synthesized via a hydrothermal method. N doping significantly improved the photocatalytic efficiency of SrTiO3 in water splitting, with average hydrogen and oxygen production rates of 36.79 \u03bcmol h\u20131 and 18.66 \u03bcmol h\u20131, respectively, which is approximately 3.4 times higher than that of pure SrTiO3. First-principles calculations combined with diffuse reflectance spectroscopy demonstrated that under conventional doping conditions, N doping does not lead to a reduction in the bandgap of SrTiO3, indicating that the primary reason for the enhanced photocatalytic activity differs from that of N-doped TiO2 and is not due to an enhanced response to visible light. Further studies showed that upon introduction of nitrogen into the SrTiO3 lattice, the difference in electronegativity between N and O increased the charge density around the Ti 3d orbitals, causing an upward shift in the Fermi level, increased the depletion layer thickness, and promoted carrier transport and separation. This suggests that the primary reason for the performance improvement may be the enhanced efficiency of carrier transport and separation. This finding could contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the effects of nonmetal ion doping on the properties of SrTiO3 and its potential applications."

      "title": "Enhanced Photodetection Performance of WSe",
      "abstract": "The two-dimensional (2D) chalcogenide WSe2/V2O5 composite nanostructures were synthesized using the hydrothermal method and extensively characterized with various spectroscopic techniques. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis confirmed the hexagonal crystal structure exhibiting space symmetry of P63/mmc. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images provided insights into the irregular and non-uniform morphology. Optical spectrum analysis indicated a band gap value of 2.01 eV for 15% WSe2/V2O5 nanostructures, as determined by the Wood and Tauc equation. Photoluminescence (PL) excitation spectra at emission wavelengths of 550 and 750 nm exhibited broad emission attributed to self-trapped excitons for V2O5 and WSe2 nanostructures. Under excitation at \u03bbexc = 365 nm, PL emission spectra displayed distinct peaks at 550 and 750 nm, demonstrating the ability to emit vivid red light. A device optimized for photoresponsivity (R) of approximately 7.80\u00d710-1 AW-1 and detectivity (D) of around 8.65\u00d71011 Jones, and quantum efficiency (QE) of approximately 3.42\u00d710-2 AW-1 were achieved at a wavelength of 390 nm while using a lamination sheet as a substrate. These findings underscore the capability of devices for efficient photoconversion at specified wavelengths, indicating potential applications in sensing, imaging, and optical communication. The photoresponsivity of the device remained stable at 3.38\u00d710-3 AW\u207b1 at 0\u00b0 and 3.09\u00d710-3 AW\u207b1 at 55\u00b0 bending angle. This indicates the resilience of device to mechanical strain, making it ideal for flexible and wearable sensor applications. The structural, morphological, and optical characterizations confirm the suitability of luminescent WSe2/V2O5 chalcogenide for practical optoelectronic applications, especially in display technologies."

      "abstract": "The crystal engineering of eight H-bonded metal assemblies based on a combination of Cu2+/(2,3-pyridyl)dicarboxylate moieties and N-heterocyclic derivatives is described. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction characterization revealed that all arrays were built from the self-assembly of their components via supramolecular heterodimeric synthons between carboxylic acid and pyridine groups. Compounds 1-3 form 2D arrays based on the self-assembly of metal-organic chains [Cu(2,3-Hpdc)]n or {[Cu(2,3-pdc)]2-}n with pyridyl compounds through hydrogen bonding interactions. Compounds 4-6 consist of 2D H-bonded double ribbons/layers, enabling the intercalation of stilbazole molecules head-to-tail fashion between metallic dimers [Cu2(2,3-pdc)4]4-. Compounds 7-8 were built from a mononuclear Cu2+ complex self-assembled via H-bonding interactions. As [Cu(2,3-Hpdc)2(4,4\u00b4-bpe)2] (7) displays a 3-fold parallel interpenetrated 2D H-bonded network, [Cu(2,3-pdc)(2,3-Hpdc)(OH2)]- (8) forms H-bonded bilayers between the Cu2+ complexes and water crystallization molecules. Adjacent bilayers are linked by a photoproduct generated in situ via a single-crystal-to-single-crystal transformation. These arrays 4, 7 and 8 are photoactive in the solid state upon UV irradiation, leading to the regioselective synthesis of rctt-cyclobutane derivatives in high-to-moderate yields. The structure-templating features of these arrays are described in terms of the concomitance of multiple supramolecular interactions. They encoded self-complementary donor-acceptor site information through a recurrent pattern of H-bonding preferences. These assemblies resulted from the concurrence of heterosynthons between the carboxylic and pyridyl groups and the presence of short contacts between the double bonds of the N-heterocycle derivatives, assisted by cation\u2212\u03c0 interactions and metal-building units with a modulable multivalency capacity."

      "title": "Applicability and limitation of aromatic maturity parameters in high-maturity oil from ultra-deep reservoirs",
      "abstract": "A substantial reserve of highly mature light oil has been discovered in the Ordovician reservoir of the Shunbei Oilfield, Tarim Basin, NW China. This study aims to provide an objective assessment of oil maturity in the Shunbei Oilfield and establish a reliable maturity evaluation index for oil in the high thermal evolution stage. Eighteen crude oil samples from the No. 4 fault zone (F4) of Shunbei Oilfield were systematically analyzed. Aromatic hydrocarbon, light hydrocarbon components, and diamondoid compositions were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The depositional environment and the organic matter input of their related source rocks were determined by corresponding geochemical indicators. The results indicate that the F4 oils have been derived from the same source kitchen and belong to the same oil population. The oil maturity in the study area was evaluated by the maturity parameters relative to aromatics, light hydrocarbons, and diamondoid. The analysis indicates that the results of aromatic parameters for identifying oil maturity contradict those of light hydrocarbon and diamondoid parameters. The equivalent vitrinite reflectance of the oil samples ranges from 1.43% to 1.54%. It is concluded that light hydrocarbon and diamondoid parameters can reliably be used to evaluate the maturity of oil in the high thermal evolution stage. However, most of the aromatic maturity parameters exhibit significant limitations during the high thermal evolution stage. The maturity parameters of phenanthrene and dibenzothiophene were \"reversed\" in the high thermal evolution stage due to demethylation and thermal alteration, respectively. Additionally, most naphthalene maturity parameters are affected by thermally induced condensation, rendering them unsuitable for maturity evaluation of the high thermal evolution stage. Notably, pentamethylnaphthalene ratio (PMNr, PMNr=1, 2, 4, 6, 7-/ (1, 2, 4, 6, 7 + 1, 2, 3, 5, 6)-pentamethylnaphthalene) exhibits a strong positive correlation with gas-oil ratio (GOR), n-heptane /methylcyclohexane (nC7/MCH) ratio, and (3+4)-methyldiamantane (MD) concentrations, indicating their reliability as maturity indicators for high to over mature oils and source rocks."

      "abstract": "This study evaluated the ecotoxicological effects of weathered oil fragments (WOFs) collected four years after the 2019\u20132020 Brazilian oil spill on Scinax fuscovarius tadpoles, a species commonly found in mangrove-adjacent ecosystems. Tadpoles were exposed to WOFs at 1 g/L (WOF-I) and 4.5 g/L (WOF-II) for 21 days. Growth inhibition, oxidative stress, and genotoxicity were observed in both exposed groups. Compared to controls, WOF exposure resulted in up to 25.1% higher total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) accumulation in intestines, 400% more erythrocyte nuclear abnormalities, and significantly elevated DNA damage (tail DNA% and olive tail moment). Biochemical responses included increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), and corticosterone levels, along with altered antioxidant enzyme activities and upregulation of digestive enzymes. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) explained 75.1% and 24.9% of the variance in PC1 and PC2, respectively, highlighting oxidative stress, corticosterone, and genotoxicity as key factors in discrimination. Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) confirmed group separation, with greater response variability in WOF-II. These findings demonstrate that WOFs remain toxic years after their release, posing a threat to amphibians in transitional ecosystems. The study highlights the importance of long-term monitoring and remediation efforts that extend beyond marine environments."

The dynamic change of interfacial tension under mass transfer conditions has significant influence on the accuracy of the simulation, yet has never been considered in previous study because of the lacking of experimental data on dynamic interfacial tension (DIFT). In this study, the DIFT model from previous work (Wang et al., AIChE J. 2024; e18411) is incorporated into the CFD- PBM simulation to simulate two-phase flow in a pulsed column under conditions of mass transfer. Simulation results, including the cumulative droplet size distribution (Q3) and solute concentration in two phases, are in good agreement with experimental results, demonstrating the necessity of the DIFT model. As height decreases, it is found that the reduction in mass transfer flux and solute concentration, leading to an increase in DIFT, that is the reason for the decrease in droplet breakup frequency."

In contrast to group 7\u201312 elements, Cr in group 6 has not yet been investigated as the catalyst of CO2 photoreduction because of its intrinsic disadvantages. Cr has a weak reducing ability due to an insufficient number of d electrons and high Lewis acidity which may deactivate the catalyst by strong coordination with a product formate. To overcome these drawbacks, we rationally designed molecular Cr complexes bearing ferrocenyl PNNP tetradentate ligands (FcCrCy, FcCriPr, FcCrtBu, and FcCrPh). These Cr complexes selectively converted CO2 into formic acid (HCO2H) under photocatalytic conditions and, to our knowledge, represent the first molecular Cr catalysts for CO2 photoreduction. The best catalyst FcCrPh achieved a turnover number of 1180 for HCO2H formation with 86% selectivity after 48 h light irradiation, with a combined use of an organic photosensitizer. Electrochemical and continuous UV\u2013vis absorption analyses clarified the sequential reaction pathways involving multi-electron reduction and protonation of a Cr complex. Moreover, through detailed computational studies, photo-induced electron transfer mediated by ferrocenyl groups and intramolecular proton transfer attributed to hemilabile phosphine ligands would be key to the efficient catalysis that overwhelms the inherent disadvantages of Cr."

In this research, p-n heterojunctions are successfully constructed by metal oxides derived from metal organic frameworks (MOFs). MOFs-derived bimetallic Co3O4/SnO2 microspheres are prepared by precipitation. The gas sensing performance shows that the Co3O4/SnO2 sensor exhibits extremely high response (Ra/Rg=641) to 20 ppm n-butanol at 200 \u00b0C, which is 19 times that of the pristine SnO2. It can detect n-butanol gas at low concentration, and has good selectivity to alcohol gas, and reduces the interference of benzene gas. The improved of gas sensitivity can be attributed to the formation of stable heterojunction between Co3O4 and SnO2, resulting in a greater resistance change of Co3O4/SnO2. Co3O4/SnO2 inherits the characteristics of high specific surface area (SSA) of MOFs, which provides abundant sites for the reaction of target gas and oxygen molecules. Finally, the gas sensing mechanism of the Co3O4/SnO2 based sensor is discussed in detail."

Additionally, the same end-group allows for further functionalization via inverse electron demand Diels-Alder chemistry using trans-cyclooctene.

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Polymer composite materials require softening to reduce their glass transition temperature and improve processability. To this end, plasticizers, which are small organic molecules, are added to the polymer matrix. The miscibility of these plasticizers has a large impact on their effectiveness and, therefore, their interactions with the polymer matrix must be carefully considered. Many plasticizer characteristics, including their size, topology and flexibility, can impact their miscibility and, because of the exponentially large number of plasticizers, the current trial-and-error approach is very ineffective. In this work we show that using coarse-grained molecular simulations of a small dataset of 48 plasticizers, it is possible to identify topological and thermodynamic descriptors that are proxy for their miscibility. Using ad-hoc molecular dynamics simulation set-ups that are relatively computationally inexpensive, we establish correlations between the plasticizers\u2019 topology, internal flexibility, thermodynamics of aggregation and their degree of miscibility, and use these descriptors to classify the molecules as miscible or immiscible. With all available data, we also construct a decision tree model which achieves a F1 score of 0.86 \u00b1 0.01 with repeated, stratified 5-fold cross-validation, indicating that this machine learning method can be a promising route to fully automate the screening. By evaluating the individual performance of the descriptors, we show this procedure enables a 10-fold reduction of the test space and provides the basis for the development of workflows which can efficiently screen plasticizers with a variety of topological features. The approach is used here to screen for apolar plasticizers in polyisoprene melts but similar proxies would be valid for other polyolefins, while, in cases where polar interactions drive the miscibility, other descriptors are likely to be needed."

      "abstract": "Geopolymers are emerging as sustainable alternatives to Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC), offering high strength, lightweight properties, and a lower environmental impact, making them promising materials for green concrete technologies. In this study, we synthesized graphene-based geopolymer nanocomposites using various functional graphene derivatives such as graphene oxide (GO), sulfonated graphene oxide (G-SO3H) thiographene (G-SH), and phosphate graphene (G-PO3H), along with alumina- and silica-rich waste materials such as fly ash and dolomite, to enhance mechanical properties including setting time, flowability, compressive strength, and water absorption. The functional groups on graphene derivatives improve particle dispersion and matrix density, enhancing compressive strength, while Raman spectroscopy reveals spectral shifts at interfaces of phosphate graphene with dolomite and fly ash, indicating interactions. The resultant FDGP exhibits significantly higher compressive strength of 45.60 MPa at 7 days and 50.20 MPa at 28 days compared to GO, G-SH, and G-SO3H. The high concentration of phosphate functional groups promotes strong interactions with the geopolymer matrix, improving its workability. Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) calculations elucidate the role of functional groups in graphene-based geopolymer concrete, enhancing molecular interactions and promoting robust interfacial adhesion with the geopolymer matrix for superior performance. We studied the time-dependent interactions of functionalized graphene oxide phosphate using DFT and other characterization methods, revealing strong hydrogen bonding that enhances dispersion and reinforcement within the geopolymer matrix."
